# 🚀 100 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to the most comprehensive, beginner-friendly DSA course designed to transform you from a coding novice to a problem-solving expert in just 100 days!

## 📋 Course Overview

This course covers fundamental to advanced Data Structures and Algorithms topics through daily, hands-on practice. Each day focuses on one concept or problem, building your skills progressively from basic array operations to complex dynamic programming solutions.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this 100-day journey, you will:
- ✅ Master all fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- ✅ Understand and implement essential algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal)
- ✅ Solve complex problems using dynamic programming and advanced techniques
- ✅ Analyze time and space complexity like a pro
- ✅ Handle edge cases and write robust, production-ready code
- ✅ Confidently tackle technical interviews and coding challenges

## 📚 Prerequisites

- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Variables, functions, loops, conditionals
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Basic algebra and logical thinking
- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Curiosity and persistence
- **Development Environment**: Python 3.8+ installed on your system

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your local machine
2. **Install Python 3.8+** from [python.org](https://python.org)
3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
4. **Navigate** to any day's folder and start coding!
5. **Optional**: Install pytest for running test cases:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

## 📅 Course Structure

The course is organized into themed weeks:

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

Each day contains:
```
day_XX/
├── README.md          # Detailed problem explanation
├── solution.py        # Clean, commented Python solution
└── test.py           # Test cases and examples
```

## 📖 How to Use This Course

1. **Daily Practice**: Dedicate 1-2 hours each day to one problem
2. **Read First**: Start with the README.md for problem understanding
3. **Try Yourself**: Attempt the problem before looking at the solution
4. **Learn**: Study the provided solution and explanations
5. **Test**: Run the test cases to verify your understanding
6. **Review**: Revisit previous topics weekly for retention
