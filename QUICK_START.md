# üéØ Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your 100-day DSA journey! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## üöÄ Getting Started (5 minutes)

### 1. Verify Python Installation
```bash
python --version
```
You need Python 3.8 or higher.

### 2. Navigate to Day 1
```bash
cd day_01
```

### 3. Read the Problem
Open `README.md` to understand today's challenge.

### 4. Try It Yourself (15-30 minutes)
Attempt the problem before looking at the solution.

### 5. Study the Solution
Open `solution.py` to see the implementation and explanations.

### 6. Run Tests
```bash
python test.py
```

### 7. Experiment
Modify the code, try different approaches, break things and fix them!

## üìÖ Daily Routine

### Morning (30-45 minutes)
- Read the day's README.md
- Understand the problem thoroughly
- Attempt your own solution

### Afternoon (30-45 minutes)
- Study the provided solution
- Understand the algorithm and complexity
- Run the tests and experiments

### Evening (15-30 minutes)
- Review and make notes
- Think about related problems
- Plan tomorrow's session

## üéØ Weekly Goals

- **Week 1**: Get comfortable with the routine, master arrays
- **Week 2**: Understand time/space complexity deeply
- **Week 3**: Start recognizing patterns
- **Week 4**: Feel confident with basic data structures
- **Continue**: Build on previous knowledge, tackle harder problems

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Consistency > Intensity**: 1 hour daily beats 7 hours once a week
2. **Don't Rush**: Understand deeply rather than moving fast
3. **Take Notes**: Write down patterns and insights
4. **Practice Explaining**: Teach the concept to someone (or yourself)
5. **Connect Concepts**: See how today's lesson relates to previous days

## üÜò When You're Stuck

1. **Re-read the problem** - often the solution is in the constraints
2. **Draw it out** - visualize with simple examples
3. **Start simple** - solve for small inputs first
4. **Look for patterns** - what have you seen before that's similar?
5. **Check the hints** - each README has optimization tips

## üèÜ Success Metrics

By Day 30, you should:
- [ ] Recognize basic patterns (two pointers, sliding window)
- [ ] Understand Big O notation intuitively
- [ ] Feel comfortable with arrays, strings, and basic data structures

By Day 60, you should:
- [ ] Implement tree algorithms confidently
- [ ] Solve graph problems systematically
- [ ] Choose appropriate data structures for problems

By Day 100, you should:
- [ ] Tackle any DSA problem with confidence
- [ ] Optimize solutions for time and space
- [ ] Be ready for technical interviews
