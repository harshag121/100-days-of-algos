Create a 100-day Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course in Python from scratch, designed to help learners master DSA with simplicity and clarity. The course should:

1. **Structure**: Cover fundamental to advanced DSA topics (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.) over 100 days, with one problem or concept per day. Ensure a logical progression, starting with basics and gradually increasing complexity.

2. **Simplicity**: Write clean, beginner-friendly Python code optimized for readability and minimal complexity. Avoid overly clever or obscure solutions.

3. **Edge Cases**: For each problem, include solutions that handle all edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, single elements, large inputs, invalid inputs). Explain these edge cases clearly in the code comments and README.

4. **README Files**: For each problem, provide a detailed README.md file in Markdown format, including:
   - Problem description with examples.
   - Input/output format.
   - Constraints and edge cases.
   - Step-by-step explanation of the solution approach.
   - Time and space complexity analysis.
   - Interactive examples (e.g., diagrams, pseudocode, or visualizations where applicable).
   - Tips for optimization or alternative approaches.
   - Links to related problems or concepts for further learning.

5. **Interactivity**: Include engaging explanations in the READMEs, using analogies, real-world examples, or visual aids (e.g., text-based diagrams or suggestions for graphical visualizations) to make concepts intuitive. Add optional challenges or follow-up questions to encourage active learning.

6. **Course Organization**:
   - Provide a daily schedule (e.g., Day 1: Array basics, Day 2: Two-pointer technique, etc.).
   - Group problems by topic (e.g., Weeks 1-2: Arrays and Strings, Weeks 3-4: Linked Lists).
   - Include a main README for the course with an overview, learning objectives, prerequisites (basic Python knowledge), and setup instructions.
   - Suggest practice platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank) for supplementary problems.

7. **Deliverables**:
   - A folder structure for the course (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`, etc.), each containing:
     - Python solution file (e.g., `solution.py`).
     - README.md with the detailed explanation.
     - Optional: Test cases in a separate file (e.g., `test.py`) to verify the solution.
   - A `course_schedule.md` file outlining the 100-day plan.
   - A main `README.md` for the entire course.

8. **Best Practices**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions and code formatting (e.g., PEP 8).
   - Ensure solutions are efficient but prioritize clarity for beginners.
   - Make the course modular, allowing learners to skip or revisit topics.
   - Include motivational tips or milestones (e.g., "By Day 50, youâ€™ll master trees!").

The goal is to create a self-paced, interactive, and comprehensive DSA course that feels approachable yet thorough, enabling learners to confidently tackle DSA problems by Day 100.
